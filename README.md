# JSON_Beef
A JSON parser library made in the Beef programming language.

Still a work in progress.

Todo:
- JSON String parsing:
  - Handle unescaped characters in strings as error.
  - Parse UTF-8 characters e.g.: u0063.
- Object deserialization:
  - Create and add to a List<T> object through reflection.
